# Python_Assignment_4
contains the solution related to file &amp; exception handling.

--Task_1-working
  first of all we open the file in read mode.
  to read all lines of file we will use readlines() method.
  to get the data line by line we will use for loop.
  to handle the error when file not found we use try and except block.

--Task_2-Working
  first we get the input from the user and store it in a variable.
  after that open the file in write mode to write the data with the help of write method.
  to append the data we open the file again in append mode.
  after that append the data with write method.
  to read the all content of the file we open file again in read mode.
  to read all the data of the file we can use directly for loop on file handle variable.
